    <H2>Ingredients</H2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup non-dairy milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon chia seeds</li>
        <li>1 hulled hemp seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <H3><strong>Optional add-in</strong></H3> 
    <ul>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>   
    <H2>Instructions</H2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the plant milk of choice to a blender cup, then tip in chia seeds, hemp seeds, cardamom and maple syrup. Blend until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the chia hemp mixture into a tupperware or container that can be sealed and set aside in the fridge for 1-2 hours. Stir, if you can, after 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon into your serving bowl and add any toppings you like.</li>
     </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pour the milk into the blender cup first, or I find that the seeds and maple syrup stick to the bottom of the cup.</li>
        <li>Add more spice and maple syrup to taste preference.</li>
        <li>For a much thicker pudding, add an extra tablespoon of chia seeds.</li>
    </ul>
